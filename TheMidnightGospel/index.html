<h3>Hi there! Welcome to my website.</h3>
<p>If you enjoy psychedelics, magic, theories, or wanna open your third eye, then you are in the right place my friend. My name is Clancy Gilroy and I'm a spacecaster. My hobbies are interviewing, slacking off and drinking.
    <br> If you want to get into a long philosophical conversation that will leave you existential, then I'm your guy! My podcast may be spiritual; however, it's far from boring. The trippy visuals you see in the episodes may be normal in the Chromatic Ribbon, but they never get old. I hope that you continue to explore this website and maybe check out some of my episodes!</p>

<section id="The goal">
    <h4><b>The goal</b></h4>
    <p>I made this website in hopes that I can promote my podcast so that beings all across the Chromatic Ribbon can experience how awesome and mind opening my podcast is (also supporting would help me get my money up so I can fix my computer… again). I also am always looking for new interviewees that will allow me to pick their brain and share their stories, so on this website you can share stories you think I should talk about as well as request an interview! Also, I now sell super wicked merch, with all sorts of different things like stickers, shirts, posters and more so make sure to check that out! </p>

<section id="Request an interview">
    <h4><b>Request &amp; Share!</b></h4>
    <p>My favourite part of doing podcasts is meeting new people and hearing new stories. If you have a story that you want me to talk about on a podcast, then you can send it to this email! If you think that you would be a good candidate and would like to collaborate, then you can send me a request. I look through new requests every week and will email you back if collaboration is on the table for us.</p>
